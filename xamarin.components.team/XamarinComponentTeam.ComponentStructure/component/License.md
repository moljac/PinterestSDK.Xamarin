### Developer terms – May 2013

Thank you for using our developer tools and features!

Pinterest offers various documentation and tools ("Developer Tools") for websites, 
app developers, API partners, and others who may be integrating Pinterest features 
or functionality into their products. These Developer Terms of Service ("Developer 
Terms”) apply to your access to and use of those tools, and by using them you agree 
to these Developer Terms and also our Privacy Policy. Our tools and these Developer 
Terms will change over time, so please check periodically to see the latest version.

#### Who can use our developer tools.

When you use our Developer Tools, you agree to form a binding contract with Pinterest, 
and follow these Developer Terms and all applicable laws. If you’re using Developer 
Tools on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) "you” includes 
you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you’re authorized to grant 
all permissions and licenses provided in these terms and bind the entity to these terms, 
and that you agree to these terms on the entity’s behalf. Some of our Developer Tools 
may be code that you incorporate into your website or products that enable Pinterest 
functionality. You agree that we may automatically update those Products, and these 
Developer Terms will apply to such updates.

#### Our license to you.

Subject to these Developer Terms and our documentation and policies (including our 
Acceptable Usage Policy, Pin Etiquette, and Rich Pin Guidelines), we grant you a limited, 
non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the Developer Tools. We 
reserve the right to limit, or temporarily or indefinitely suspend your access to the 
Developer Tools. You acknowledge that Pinterest and its end users retain all worldwide 
right, title and interest in the Developer Tools and all content made available through 
the Developer Tools, including all intellectual property rights therein.

#### Pinterest features in your product

##### Policies and guidelines

We offer Developer Tools that app developers or websites can use to offer Pinterest 
features and functionality to their users (e.g., the "Pin It” and "Follow” buttons, 
the Pinterest Widgets). You agree to use these tools only as documented by Pinterest, 
and in compliance with law and our policies and branding guidelines. You also agree 
that the Pinterest features and functionality provided by our Developer Tools will be

Developer Tools only as specified in our Logo and Brand Guidelines. You may not alter 
the appearance or functionality of the Pinterest Brand Features. You agree that you
 will not challenge Pinterest’s ownership of, the validity of any license to use,

you will immediately assign such rights to Pinterest at no expense to us.

you or your users to post or otherwise make available content in Pinterest products. 
By using these Developer Tools you give Pinterest and its users permission to such 
content as set forth in our Terms of Service. Nothing in this Section shall restrict

we can make Pinterest more awesome. If you choose to submit comments, ideas or 
feedback, you agree that we are free to use them without any restriction or 
compensation to you. By accepting your submission, Pinterest doesn’t waive any rights 
to use similar or related feedback previously known to Pinterest, or developed by its 
employees, or obtained from sources other than you.

#### Third-party Links, Sites and Services

Our Developer Tools may include or enable links to third-party websites, advertisers, 
services, special offers, or other events or activities that Pinterest doesn’t own or

third-party website, service, or content from Pinterest, you do so at your own risk.

#### Disclaimers

The Developer Tools and all included content are provided on an "as is” basis without 
warranty of any kind, whether express or implied. PINTEREST SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY 
AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, 
AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF 
TRADE. Pinterest takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any content that

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PINTEREST WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, 
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES,

INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR 
USE THE DEVELOPER TOOLS; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY MADE AVAILABLE 
THROUGH OR RELATED TO THE DEVELOPER TOOLS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY,

U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO PINTEREST FOR THE PAST THREE 
MONTHS FOR THE DEVELOPER TOOLS.

####. Arbitration

If you have a dispute with Pinterest, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve 
the dispute with us informally. If Pinterest isn’t able to resolve the dispute with you 
informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims 
for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating
to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA”) 
under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related 
Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. Unless you and Pinterest 
agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco, California. Each 
party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees 
in accordance with AAA rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of 
arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. 
Any judgment on the award the arbitrator renders may be entered in any court of competent 
jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section will prevent either party from seeking injunctive or 
other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual 
property or unauthorized access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ 
INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR 
REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT 
CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS YOU AGREE THAT 
YOU AND PINTEREST EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A 
CLASS ACTION.

#### Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Developer Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without 
respect to its conflict of laws principles. We each agree to submit to the personal 
jurisdiction of a state court located in Santa Clara County, California or the United 
States District Court for the Northern District of California, for any actions not 
subject to Section 11 (Arbitration). Our Developer Tools are controlled and operated 
from the United States, and we make no representations that they are appropriate or 
available for use in other locations.

#### General Terms

Notification Procedures and changes to these Terms. Pinterest reserves the right to 
determine the form and means of sending you notifications, and you agree to receive 
legal notices electronically if we so choose. We may revise these Terms from time to 
time and the most current version will always be posted on our website. If a revision, 
in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you. By continuing to access or use 
the Developer Tools after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the 
revised terms. If you don’t agree to the new terms, please stop using the Developer 
Tools. Assignment. You may not transfer or assign these Terms or any rights and 
licenses granted hereunder, but they may be assigned by Pinterest without restriction. 
Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void. Entire 
Agreement/Severability. These terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any amendments 
and any additional agreements you may enter into with Pinterest in connection with the 
Products, will constitute the entire agreement between you and Pinterest concerning the 
Developer Tools and supersede any prior terms you have with Pinterest regarding the 
Products. If any provision of these Developer Terms is deemed invalid, then that 
provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the 
remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. No Waiver. No waiver of any 
term of these Developer Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such 
term or any other term, and Pinterest’s failure to assert any right or provision under 
these Developer Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. U.S. 
Government Agencies. If you’re a United States federal government agency, this amendment 
applies to these terms.
