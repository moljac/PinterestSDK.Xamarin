#Pinterest#

Pinterest is a visual discovery tool that people use to collect ideas 
for their different projects and interests. People create and share 
collections (called "boards") of visual bookmarks (called "Pins") that 
they use to do things like plan trips and projects, organize events or 
save articles and recipes.

# PinterestSDK #

The Pin It button helps people Pin content from the web, some site.

This SDK will let your users create Pinterest content inside mobile 
app with just a few lines of code. Right now, we only support adding an 
image from a URL. In the future, we'll support adding local images.

Mobile SDKs:

*	iOS SDK 		
	[https://developers.pinterest.com/ios/](https://developers.pinterest.com/ios/)		
	This SDK requires the Pinterest app to be installed. If version
	2.3 or higher of the Pinterest app isn't installed, the Pin It button will 
	redirect the user to the app store to download it. 		
	Pinterest app only supports iOS5 and higher.
*	Android SDK			
	This SDK lets your users create Pinterest content inside mobile app with 
	just a few lines of code. Pinterest support two types of Pin sources: image 
	URL and image URI. Image URL lets user specify the direct path to an image 
	on the web, while image URI lets user specify a path on the device.			
	This SDK requires the Pinterest app to be installed. We've provided helper 
	methods to determine if Pin It Button SDK is supported and Pinterest 1.3 or 
	higher is installed. This should allow user to remove Pin It in cases where 
	it is not.
